# Consumption tax data including sales taxes, VAT, and Excise tax Revenue

The Tax Foundationâ€™s publication [Consumption Tax Policies in OECD Countries](https://taxfoundation.org/consumption-tax-policies/) shows to what extent OECD countries rely on different consumption tax revenue sources and discusses the variation of these policies throughout the OECD.

## The Dataset and its Tax Revenue Categories and Scope

### The Datasets
The majority of the data used in this publication comes from OECD data sources, primarily Consumption Tax Trends (https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/taxation/consumption-tax-trends-2020_152def2d-en) and the OECD's Revenue Statistics dataset (https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=REV).


### Revenue Categories
The OECD's  Revenue Statistics Database provides various categories for the different tax revenue sources. For our report, we chose the categories as follows:

* **Consumption Taxes:** Covers the OECD category *5000 Taxes on goods and services*.
* **Value added Taxes:** Covers the OECD category *5111 Taxes on goods and services*.
* **Sales Taxes:** Covers the OECD category *5112 Taxes on goods and services*.
* **Excise Taxes:** Covers the OECD category *5121 Taxes on goods and services*.
* **Other:** Covers the unallocated portion of Consumption Taxes.

## Explanation of Files in Repository

### /main directory

Location of the R code, the source documentation, and this README.

The R code reads in and downloads the necessary data, cleans the data, adds missing data manually (except for `reduced_rates_base.csv`), merges datasets, and produces intermediate and final output datasets and tables.

The source documentation cites all the sources used.

### /source-data

Location of **input** files to .R code file including:

- `country-codes.csv` Dataset that includes all 249 sovereign states and dependent territories that have been assigned a country code by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Includes official country names in various languages, ISO country codes, continents, and further geographical information.
